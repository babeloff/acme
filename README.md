flechar (first-person singular present flecho, first-person singular preterite flech√©, past participle flechado)

    to draw (a bow)
    to shoot with an arrow; to put an arrow through 
    to sweep off someone's feet


It has been suggested that a better name for category theory would be archery, the study of arrows.
But really archery is the study of bows, the arch.

This tool is designed to make the examination of categories easier.
It will incorporate any number of visualizations which may be of use
to the working applied flechador.

The initial tool will be to represent gremlin property graphs with cytoscape.js
Following that effort the deck.gl library will be incorporated.
Next three.js will be added.

From there I will look at other tools.

My original intent was to do this in Kotlin but the javascript / multiplatform 
implementations for those tools is still very much in flux.

Instead I will be making use of Clojure and Fulcro.

At some point I hope to port TinkerGraph to Kotlin in a browser compatible way.
